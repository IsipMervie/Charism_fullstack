This document summarizes all the changes made to:
1. Remove Cloudinary dependency and replace with local file storage
2. Fix email links for password reset and verification
3. Fix image display issues on Vercel
4. Ensure proper environment variable configuration

### 2. Local File Storage Implementation

#### New Storage Structure
```
uploads/
├── profile-pictures/     # User profile pictures
├── event-images/         # Event images
├── logos/               # School logos
├── event-docs/          # Event documentation
└── temp/                # Temporary uploads
```

#### Key Features
- Automatic directory creation
- Unique filename generation with timestamps
- Lowercase file extensions for consistency
- Proper file type filtering
- File size limits enforced

#### File Handling
- Images are stored locally in organized folders
- URLs are generated as relative paths (e.g., `/uploads/profile-pictures/filename.png`)
- Static file serving through Express middleware
- Proper CORS headers for image access

### 3. Email Link Fixes

#### Issues Addressed
- Password reset links not working in Gmail
- Email verification links failing
- Event registration links broken

#### Solution Implemented
- Created robust email link generator utility
- Multiple fallback URLs for different environments
- Priority-based URL selection
- Environment variable validation

#### Environment Variables Required
```
FRONTEND_URL_PRODUCTION=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
FRONTEND_URL_VERCEL=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
```

### 4. Image Display Fixes

#### Issues Addressed
- Images not showing on Vercel
- Incorrect file paths
- Case-sensitive filename issues
- Browser cache problems

#### Solution Implemented
- Consistent file path generation
- Lowercase file extensions
- Proper static file serving
- CORS headers for image access
- Relative URL paths for frontend

## Migration Steps

### 1. Environment Variables
1. Set proper frontend URLs in Vercel backend environment
2. Configure CORS origins correctly
3. Ensure all required variables are set

### 2. File Uploads
1. New uploads will use local storage automatically
2. Existing Cloudinary URLs will need manual migration if required
3. Images are now served from `/uploads` routes

### 3. Frontend Updates
1. Frontend already uses updated image utilities
2. Image URLs are generated correctly
3. No additional frontend changes required

## Testing

### 1. Email Links
```bash
cd backend
node test-email-links.js
```

### 2. Image Uploads
1. Upload profile picture
2. Upload event image
3. Upload logo
4. Verify images display correctly

### 3. API Endpoints
1. Test file upload endpoints
2. Verify image serving
3. Check CORS configuration

## Benefits of Changes

### 1. Cost Reduction
- No more Cloudinary API costs
- Local storage is free
- Reduced external dependencies

### 2. Performance
- Faster image loading (no external API calls)
- Better control over file storage
- Reduced network latency

### 3. Reliability
- No external service dependencies
- Consistent file handling
- Better error control

### 4. Maintenance
- Simpler deployment
- Easier debugging
- More predictable behavior

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### 1. Storage Limits
- Vercel has file size limits
- Consider implementing file cleanup
- Monitor storage usage

### 2. File Persistence
- Vercel may reset files on redeploy
- Consider external storage for production
- Implement backup strategies

### 3. Performance at Scale
- Local storage may not scale well
- Consider CDN for static assets
- Implement caching strategies

## Next Steps

### 1. Immediate
1. Deploy changes to Vercel
2. Test email functionality
3. Verify image uploads work
4. Check all links function correctly

### 2. Short Term
1. Monitor file storage usage
2. Test with real users
3. Gather feedback on performance
4. Implement any necessary optimizations

### 3. Long Term
1. Consider implementing CDN
2. Add file compression
3. Implement automated cleanup
4. Add file backup strategies

## Support

If issues arise:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test email link generation
4. Check file upload endpoints
5. Review CORS configuration

## Notes

- **Backup**: Always backup important files before major changes
- **Testing**: Test thoroughly in staging before production
- **Monitoring**: Keep an eye on storage usage and performance
- **Documentation**: Update any user-facing documentation about file uploads
