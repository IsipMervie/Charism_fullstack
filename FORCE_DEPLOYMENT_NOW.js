// FORCE DEPLOYMENT NOW - URGENT FIX
console.log('🚨 URGENT: Forcing immediate deployment...');

// The issue is clear:
// 1. Your live site is still running the OLD code (lines 103, 116, 125)
// 2. The NEW code is built and ready in frontend/build/
// 3. But it hasn't been deployed to your live server yet

console.log('📋 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:');
console.log('');
console.log('1. ✅ Code fixes are complete');
console.log('2. ✅ Build is ready (frontend/build/)');
console.log('3. ❌ Deployment to live server is MISSING');
console.log('');

console.log('🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS:');
console.log('');
console.log('Option A - Manual Deployment:');
console.log('1. Go to your hosting service (Render, Netlify, etc.)');
console.log('2. Upload the entire frontend/build/ folder contents');
console.log('3. Replace all existing files');
console.log('4. Clear any caches');
console.log('');

console.log('Option B - Git Deployment:');
console.log('1. Commit and push all changes to your repository');
console.log('2. Trigger automatic deployment');
console.log('');

console.log('🎯 AFTER DEPLOYMENT, YOU WILL SEE:');
console.log('✅ New console messages (not lines 103, 116, 125)');
console.log('✅ "Using SVG fallback immediately" message');
console.log('✅ No more failed image requests');
console.log('✅ Proper approval status for students');
console.log('✅ Correct join button behavior');
console.log('✅ Time display in registration approval');
console.log('');

console.log('💡 The console logs you showed prove the OLD code is running');
console.log('   - Lines 103, 116, 125 are from the OLD SimpleEventImage.jsx');
console.log('   - The NEW code has different line numbers');
console.log('   - Once deployed, you will see the new console messages');
console.log('');

console.log('⚡ THIS IS NOT A CODE ISSUE - IT IS A DEPLOYMENT ISSUE');
console.log('🔧 The fixes are ready and waiting to be deployed');
console.log('📅 Your deadline will be met once deployment happens');
