# Event Visibility and Hours Calculation Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Students Could Still See Disabled Events**
**Problem**: When events were disabled, students could still see them in the event list.

**Solution**: Updated `getAllEvents()` function to properly filter events based on user role:
- **Students**: Only see events where `isVisibleToStudents: true` AND `status !== 'Disabled'`
- **Admins/Staff**: See all events including disabled ones

**Files Modified**: `backend/controllers/eventController.js`

### 2. ✅ **Disabled Events Were Not Counting Hours**
**Problem**: When events were disabled, they were completely excluded from hours calculations, causing students to lose hours they had already earned.

**Solution**: Updated hours calculation logic to:
- **Include disabled events** for students who were already approved
- **Exclude disabled events** from new registrations and event counts
- **Preserve earned hours** for students who were already approved

**Files Modified**: 
- `backend/controllers/analyticsController.js`
- `backend/controllers/eventController.js`
- `backend/controllers/adminController.js`

### 3. ✅ **Students Could Not Upload Reflections for Disabled Events**
**Problem**: Students who were approved for events that later got disabled couldn't upload reflections.

**Solution**: Updated reflection upload logic to:
- **Allow reflection uploads** for disabled events if student was already approved
- **Prevent new registrations** for disabled events
- **Maintain access** to existing approved registrations

**Files Modified**: `backend/controllers/eventController.js`

### 4. ✅ **Event Registration for Disabled Events**
**Problem**: Students could potentially register for disabled events.

**Solution**: Updated `joinEvent()` function to:
- **Check event visibility** before allowing registration
- **Prevent registration** for disabled or hidden events
- **Maintain existing approvals** for students already registered

**Files Modified**: `backend/controllers/eventController.js`

### 5. ✅ **Event Details Access for Disabled Events**
**Problem**: Students couldn't view details of disabled events they were approved for.

**Solution**: Updated `getEventDetails()` function to:
- **Allow access** to disabled events if student was already approved
- **Block access** to disabled events for new students
- **Preserve functionality** for existing approved students

**Files Modified**: `backend/controllers/eventController.js`

## How the System Now Works

### For Students:
1. **Event List**: Only see active, visible events
2. **New Registrations**: Cannot register for disabled events
3. **Existing Approvals**: Can still access disabled events they were approved for
4. **Hours Calculation**: Disabled events still count toward their total hours
5. **Reflection Uploads**: Can still upload reflections for disabled events they're approved for

### For Admins/Staff:
1. **Event List**: See all events including disabled ones
2. **Event Management**: Can enable/disable events as needed
3. **Full Access**: Can view and manage all event details

### For Hours Calculation:
1. **New Registrations**: Only count active, visible events
2. **Existing Approvals**: Include disabled events for students already approved
3. **Preserved Hours**: Students don't lose hours from events they were approved for

## Key Functions Updated

### Backend Controllers:
- `getAllEvents()` - Proper event filtering
- `getEventDetails()` - Conditional access control
- `joinEvent()` - Registration restrictions
- `uploadReflection()` - Maintained access for approved students
- `downloadReflection()` - Maintained access for approved students

### Analytics Functions:
- `getAnalytics()` - Hours calculation includes disabled events for approved students
- `getStudents40Hours()` - Individual student hours include disabled events
- `getStudentsByYear()` - Year-based hours include disabled events

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Event Disabling
1. Create an event and have students register
2. Approve student registrations
3. Disable the event
4. **Expected Result**: Students can still see the event, upload reflections, and count hours

### Test 2: New Student Access
1. Disable an event
2. Have a new student try to register
3. **Expected Result**: New student cannot register or see the event

### Test 3: Hours Preservation
1. Disable an event with approved students
2. Check student hours calculation
3. **Expected Result**: Hours are preserved for approved students

### Test 4: Reflection Uploads
1. Disable an event with approved students
2. Have approved students upload reflections
3. **Expected Result**: Reflections can be uploaded successfully

## Security Considerations

1. **Role-based Access**: Students cannot access disabled events unless already approved
2. **Data Integrity**: Hours are preserved for legitimate approvals
3. **Prevention**: New registrations are blocked for disabled events
4. **Audit Trail**: Existing approvals maintain their functionality

## Benefits of These Fixes

1. **Student Experience**: Students don't lose access to events they were approved for
2. **Hours Integrity**: Community service hours are preserved
3. **Admin Control**: Admins can disable events without affecting existing approvals
4. **System Consistency**: Clear rules for what students can and cannot access
5. **Data Preservation**: No loss of student progress or submissions

## Files Modified Summary
