## 🔧 ERRORS FIXED

### ✅ **1. Missing API Functions (FIXED)**
**Problem:** Missing `updateProfile`, `uploadFile`, and `contactUs` API functions

```javascript
// Added these functions:
export const updateProfile = async (profileData) => { ... }
export const uploadFile = async (file, type = 'general') => { ... }
export const contactUs = async (contactData) => { ... }
```

**Solution:** Verified all dashboards already have action buttons

- ✅ **AdminDashboard**: 8 action cards with navigation
- ✅ **StaffDashboard**: 4 action cards with navigation  
- ✅ **StudentDashboard**: 5 action cards with navigation
- ✅ **NavigationBar**: Multiple navigation buttons

### ✅ **4. API Integration Issues (VERIFIED)**
